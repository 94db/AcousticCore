# AcousticCore
Impulse Response Acquisition for Acoustic Application

Dedicated audio measurement and analysis program to obtain acoustic room parameters.
It is a software similar to Arta or CLIOwin (two really nice software), but with an ergonomy adapted to my desires / constraints

## MAIN ROOM ACOUSTICS PARAMETERS
* Temporal decay per octave (energy, Schroeder integral),
* Reverberation times per octave T15, T20, T30,
* RTuser with manually adjustable slope,
* Truncation Noise Elimination,
* Display of reverberation times calculated as curves or histograms,
* Calculation of Clarity Indices (C50, C80),
* Definition D50,
* Bass Ratio,
* Fast Fourier Transform,
* Signal windowing (rectangular, hanning, hamming, blackman, etc.),
* Smoothing FFT by 1/1, 1/3, 1/6, 1/12, 1/24, 1/48 octave or no smoothing,
* Cumulative Spectrogram.

## AUDIO GENERATOR
* Noise White, Pink, Brown,
* Sine sweep linear,
* Sine sweep logarithmic.
## MEASUREMENT
* Management of microphone input and measurement parameters (length),
* Adjustable trigger system.
